# iris-api
Dalet's Iris Network Appliance OpenAPI definition and SDKs

Iris API is compliant with [OpenAPI v2](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) specifications (also known as Swagger).

Any change to the API must be performed in the **openapi** directory files. Makefile and build scripts will take care of auto-generating Golang code for both Server, Client and CLI SDKs, ready-to-consumed by your favorite apps.
